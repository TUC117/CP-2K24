# CP-2K24
This project offers a comprehensive pathway from beginner to pro in Competitive Programming (CP). Mentees will dig into essential data structures and algorithms vital for CP, drawing from standard algorithmic literature and competitive programming handbooks. Through problem-solving on platforms like CSES Problem Set and Codeforces, alongside tailored weekly or biweekly assignments, participants will steadily build their skills. The goal is to encourage comfort and proficiency in commonly used CP algorithms and structures, providing guidance, experiences, and strategies along the way. By embracing a supportive community atmosphere and regular participation in CP contests, mentees can expect a journey of continuous improvement, ultimately transforming from novices to adept CP practitioners.
